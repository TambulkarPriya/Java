🌟 Introduction to Java

Java is a powerful, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language used to build everything from simple programs to enterprise-level, cloud-based, and mobile applications. With its strong community support, rich ecosystem, and focus on performance, Java remains one of the most trusted technologies in the software world.

✨ Java Features

🧱 Object-Oriented — Everything is based on classes and objects.

🌍 Platform Independent (WORA) — Runs anywhere using the JVM.

🔐 Secure & Robust — Memory management and exception handling.

⚡ Multithreading — Perform multiple tasks in parallel.

🧹 Automatic Memory Management — Garbage Collection.

📚 Rich Standard Library — Collections, I/O, networking, utilities, etc.

🚀 High Performance — JIT compiler enhances execution speed.


✔ Build strong backend knowledge
✔ Become job-ready as a Java Developer
✔ Prepare for real-world enterprise projects
✔ Learn Spring, Spring Boot, Microservices & AWS
✔ Clear Java Certification (OCP)

Java is not just a skill — it’s the foundation for my tech career.
